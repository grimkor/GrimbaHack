RJ Changes:

Added Magic Series to start of beginner (Show that the normals are multiple hits)

Added 2H > 5M Confirm to start of beginner (Show that you don't have to cancel into jS)

Removed EZ BnB 2 (I wanted to keep any dashes mid combo out of beginner)

Added Throw Confirm before beginner throw combo (Show that you can cancel into 6SM)

Added Wolf Wheel Alpha midscreen Confirm to start of advanced (Practice the dashes)

Added OTG Options to start of advanced (Show the different way RJ can OTG so they get creative with the order)

Removed 6SM > 2L Confirm from advanced (Distance dependant but I'm saving the file just in case we decided to keep it later)

Added Stump Loop Practice to start of expert (Show that you can stump with 5L or 2L)
(Note: Idk if there's a way to show that 5L stumps aren't universal)

Removed MidScreen Back Throw Confirm (Basically frame perfect, not worth it for learning the character bc no one goes for it)

Changed all bonus combos to their respective difficulties
