Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/grimkor/GrimbaHack/wiki) for instructions on how to install and use the mod.


# TODO
- Way to download combos
  - Menu option for sure in GrimbaHack menu
- Auto-combo generation output for combo builder
  - Better symbol coverage per character
  - Better way to edit this shit?
- Remove old menus no longer required
- Look at OnlineTrainingMode
