# GrimbaHack - Power Rangers Battle for the Grid Mod

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/grimkor/GrimbaHack/wiki) for instructions on how to install and use the mod.


# TODO
- Way to download combos
  - Menu option for sure in GrimbaHack menu
- Look at OnlineTrainingMode
- MZ option still needs to be looked at
- Maybe add SUPER/EX as defaults instead of their notation equivalent
- Add option to hide pause menu to see screen behind
